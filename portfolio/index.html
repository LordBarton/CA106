					<p>I'm Bartosz, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Dublin City University. I'm 
					originally from Poland, and I always wanted to study abroad, but I wasn't sure which course
					to pick. After finishing high school, I moved to Ireland, and that's when I got interested in 
					computer programming, especially in the C language. I worked full-time during my gap year (more on that below), 
					and then decided to pursue a Computer Science degree at DCU.</p>
					<p>In addition to my studies, my goal is to become a skilled software developer, focusing on creating useful 
					applications that can solve real problems and improve user experiences. I also hope to combine my love for travel
					with my career, working on international tech projects, collaborating with diverse teams, and experiencing different cultures.</p>
					<p>Apart from my education and career ambitions, I love exploring through travel, enjoy cooking, and I'm committed to learning
					more foreign languages.</p>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <div class="content" style="position: relative;">
					<p>During my gap year, I had the experience of working at the deli counter 
					of Dunnes Charlestown in Dublin, Ireland, from March 2023 to August 2023., I found this role to be more about 
					purpose than passion. It was an opportunity to make the most of my gap year and 
					ensure that this time was not wasted before embarking on my college journey.
					This experience was significant because it provided me with the opportunity 
					to learn valuable customer service skills and taught me the importance of commitment and 
					dedication in any job.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, my role as a Junior Site Electrician at Kabelexperte UG in
					Germany, during the Summer of 2022, was my very first job experience. It marked the beginning
					of my professional journey and instilled in me a strong work ethic and a commitment to excellence 
					that continues to guide me in my career.</p><br>
