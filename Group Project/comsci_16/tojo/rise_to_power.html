				<h2>Early service as officer</h2>
				<p>
					Upon graduating from the Japanese Military Academy in March 1902, he was commissioned as a 
					second lieutenant in the infantry of the IJA. In 1918-19, he briefly served in Siberia as 
					part of the Japanese expeditionary force sent to intervene in the Russian Civil War. 
					He served as Japanese military attache to Germany between 1919 and 1922. 
					As the Imperial Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, 
					the Japanese Army was always very strongly influenced by intellectual developments in the 
					German Army, and Tojo was no exception. In the 1920s, the German military favored preparing 
					for the next war by creating a totalitarian Wehrstaat (Defense State), an idea that was taken up 
					by the Japanese military as the "national defense state." In 1922, on his way home to Japan, 
					he took a train ride across the United States, his first and only visit to North America, which 
					left him with the impression that the Americans were a materialistic soft people devoted only to 
					making money and to hedonistic pursuits like sex, partying, and (despite Prohibition) drinking.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tojo boasted that his only hobby was his work, and he customarily brought home his 
					paperwork to work late into the night and refused to have any part in raising his children, 
					which he viewed both as a distraction from his work and a woman's work. He had his wife do all 
					the work of taking care of his children. A stern, humorless man, he was known for his brusque 
					manner, his obsession with etiquette, and for his coldness. Like almost all Japanese 
					officers at the time, he routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command when giving orders. 
					He said that face-slapping was a "means of training" men who came from families that were not part of 
					the samurai caste and for whom bushido was not second nature.
				</p>

				<p>
					In 1924, Tojo was greatly offended by the Immigration Control Act, which was passed by the US Congress. 
					It banned all Asian immigration into the United States, with many representatives and senators openly 
					saying the act was necessary because the Asians worked harder than whites. He wrote with bitterness 
					at the time that American whites would never accept Asians as equals: "It [the Immigration Control Act] 
					shows how the strong will always put their own interests first. Japan, too, has to be strong to survive 
					in the world."
				</p>

				<p>
					By 1928, he was bureau chief of the Japanese Army and was shortly thereafter 
					promoted to colonel. He began to take an interest in militarist politics during 
					his command of the 8th Infantry Regiment. Reflecting the imagery often used in 
					Japan to describe people in power, he told his officers that they were to be both a 
					"father" and a "mother" to the men under their command. Tojo often visited the 
					homes of the men under his command, assisted his men with personal problems, and made 
					loans to officers short of money. Like many other Japanese officers, he disliked 
					Western cultural influence in Japan, which was often disparaged as resulting in the ero 
					guro nansensu ("eroticism, grotesquerie and nonsense") movement as he complained about 
					such forms of "Western decadence" like young couples holding hands and kissing in public, 
					which were undermining traditional values necessary to uphold the kokutai.
				</p>

				<h2>Promotion to Army high command</h2>
				<p>
					In 1934, Hideki was promoted to major general and served as chief of the personnel 
					department within the Army Ministry. Tojo wrote a chapter in the book Hijōji kokumin 
					zenshū (Essays in time of national emergency), a book published in March 1934 by the Army 
					Ministry calling for Japan to become a totalitarian "national defense state". This book 
					of fifteen essays by senior generals argued that Japan had defeated Russia in the war of 1904-05 
					because bushidō had given the Japanese superior willpower as the Japanese did not fear death unlike 
					the Russians who wanted to live, and what was needed to win the inevitable next war 
					(against precisely whom the book did not say) was to repeat the example of the Russian-Japanese 
					war on a much greater scale by creating the "national defense state" to mobilize the entire nation 
					for war. In his essay Tojo wrote "The modern war of national defense extends over a great many 
					areas requiring "a state that can monolithically control" all aspects of the nation in the 
					political, social and economic spheres. Tojo attacked Britain, France and the United States 
					for waging "ideological war" against Japan since 1919. Tojo ended his essay stating that Japan 
					must stand tall "and spread its own moral principles to the world" as the "cultural and ideological 
					war of the 'imperial way' is about to begin".
				</p>

				<p>
					Tojo was appointed commander of the IJA 24th Infantry Brigade in August 1934. 
					In September 1935, Tojo assumed top command of the Kempeitai of the Kwantung Army 
					in Manchuria. Politically, he was nationalist, and militarist, and was nicknamed 
					"Razor" (カミソリ, Kamisori), for his reputation of having a sharp and legalistic 
					mind capable of quick decision-making. Tojo was a member of the Tōseiha ("Control Faction") 
					in the Army that was opposed by the more radical Kōdōha ("Imperial Way") faction. Both the 
					Tōseiha and the Kōdōha factions were militaristic groups that favored a policy of expansionism 
					abroad and dictatorship under the Emperor at home, but differed over the best way of achieving 
					these goals. The Imperial Way faction wanted a coup d'état to achieve a Shōwa Restoration; 
					emphasized "spirit" as the principal war-winning factor; and despite advocating socialist policies 
					at home wanted to invade the Soviet Union. The Control faction, while being willing to use 
					assassination to achieve its goals, was more willing to work within the system to achieve reforms; 
					wanted to create the "national defense state" to mobilize the entire nation before going to war and, 
					while not rejecting the idea of "spirit" as a war-winning factor, also saw military modernization as a 
					war-winning factor and the United States as a future enemy just as much as the Soviet Union.
				</p>

				<p>
					During the February 26 coup attempt of 1936, Tojo and Shigeru Honjō, 
					a noted supporter of Sadao Araki, both opposed the rebels who were associated
					with the rival "Imperial Way" faction. Emperor Hirohito himself was outraged 
					at the attacks on his close advisors, and after a brief political crisis and stalling 
					on the part of a sympathetic military, the rebels were forced to surrender. As the commander 
					of the Kempeitai, Tojo ordered the arrest of all officers in the Kwantung Army suspected of 
					supporting the coup attempt in Tokyo. In the aftermath, the Tōseiha faction purged the 
					Army of radical officers, and the coup leaders were tried and executed. After the purge, 
					Tōseiha and Kōdōha elements were unified in their nationalist but highly anti-political 
					stance under the banner of the Tōseiha military clique, which included Tojo as one of its leaders.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tojo was promoted to chief of staff of the Kwantung Army 
					in 1937. As the "Empire of Manchukuo" was, in reality, a 
					Japanese colony in all but name, the Kwangtung Army's duties were just as 
					much political as they were military. During this period, Tojo became close to Yōsuke 
					Matsuoka, the fiery ultra-nationalist CEO of the South Manchuria Railway, one of 
					Asia's largest corporations at the time, and Nobusuke Kishi, the Deputy Minister of 
					Industry in Manchukuo, who was the man de facto in charge of Manchukuo's economy. 
					Though Tojo regarded preparing for a war against the Soviet Union as his first duty, 
					Tojo also supported the forward policy in Northern China, as the Japanese sought to 
					extend their influence into China. As chief of staff, Tojo was responsible for the 
					military operations designed to increase Japanese penetration into the Inner Mongolia 
					border regions with Manchukuo. In July 1937, he personally led the units of the 1st 
					Independent Mixed Brigade in Operation Chahar, his only real combat experience.
				</p>

				<p>
					After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident marking the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, 
					Tojo ordered his forces to attack Hebei Province and other targets in northern China. 
					Tojo received Jewish refugees in accordance with Japanese national policy and rejected 
					the resulting Nazi German protests. Tojo was recalled to Japan in May 1938 to serve as 
					Vice-Minister of War under Army Minister Seishirō Itagaki. From December 1938 to 1940, 
					Tojo was Inspector-General of Army Aviation.
				</p>

				<h2>Advocacy for preventive war</h2>
				<p>
					On June 1, 1940, Emperor Hirohito appointed Kōichi Kido, a leading "reform bureaucrat" 
					as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, making him into the Emperor's leading political 
					advisor and fixer. Kido had aided in the creation in the 1930s of an alliance between 
					the "reform bureaucrats" and the Army's "Control" faction centered on Tojo and General 
					Mutō Akira. Kido's appointment also favored the rise of his allies in the Control faction. 
					On July 30, 1940, Tojo was appointed army minister in the second Fumimaro Konoe regime and remained 
					in that post in the third Konoe cabinet. Prince Konoe had chosen Tojo, a man representative of both 
					the Army's hardline views and the Control faction with whom he was considered reasonable to deal, 
					to secure the Army's backing for his foreign policy. Tojo was a militant ultra-nationalist who 
					was well respected for his work ethic and his ability to handle paperwork. He believed that the 
					emperor was a living god and favored "direct imperial rule;" that ensured that he would faithfully 
					follow any order from the emperor. Konoe favored having Germany mediate an end to the Sino-Japanese War, 
					pressured Britain to end its economic and military support of China even at the risk of war, 
					sought better relations with both Germany and the United States, and took advantage of the 
					changes in the international order caused by Germany's victories in the spring of 1940 to 
					make Japan a stronger power in Asia. Konoe wanted to make Japan the dominant power in 
					East Asia, but he also believed it was possible to negotiate a modus vivendi with the United 
					States under which the Americans would agree to recognize the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere".
				</p>

				<p>
					By 1940, Konoe, who had started the war with China in 1937, 
					no longer believed that a military solution to the "China Affair" was possible 
					and instead favored having Germany mediate an end to the war that would presumably 
					result in a pro-Japanese peace settlement, but would be less than he himself had 
					outlined in the "Konoe programme" of January 1938. For this reason, Konoe wanted 
					Tojo, a tough general whose ultra-nationalism was beyond question, to provide "cover" 
					for his attempt to seek a diplomatic solution to the war with China. Tojo was a 
					strong supporter of the Tripartite Pact between Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and 
					Fascist Italy. As the army minister, he continued to expand the war against China. 
					After negotiations with Vichy France, Japan was given permission to place its troops 
					in the southern part of French Indochina in July 1941. In spite of its formal recognition 
					of the Vichy government, the United States retaliated against Japan by imposing economic 
					sanctions in August, including a total embargo on oil and gasoline exports. On September 6, 
					a deadline of early October was fixed in the Imperial Conference for resolving the situation 
					diplomatically. On October 14, the deadline had passed with no progress.
				</p>

				<p>
					The prevailing opinion within the Japanese Army at that time was that continued 
					negotiations could be dangerous. However, Hirohito thought that he might be able to 
					control extreme opinions in the army by using the charismatic and well-connected Tojo, 
					who had expressed reservations regarding war with the West, but the emperor himself was 
					skeptical that Tojo would be able to avoid conflict. On October 13, he declared to Kōichi Kido: 
					"There seems little hope in the present situation for the Japan-U.S. negotiations. 
					This time, if hostilities erupt, I have to issue a declaration of war." During the 
					last cabinet meetings of the Konoe government, Tojo emerged as a hawkish 
					voice, saying he did not want a war with the United States but portrayed the 
					Americans as arrogant, bullying, white supremacists. He said that any compromise 
					solution would only encourage them to make more extreme demands on Japan, in which 
					case Japan might be better off choosing war to uphold national honor. Despite 
					saying he favored peace, Tojo had often declared at cabinet meetings that any withdrawal 
					from French Indochina and/or China would be damaging to military morale and might threaten 
					the kokutai; the "China Incident" could not be resolved via diplomacy and required a military 
					solution; and attempting to compromise with the Americans would be seen as weakness by them.
				</p>

				<h2>Appointment as Prime Minister</h2>
				<p>
					At the time, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni was said to be the only 
					person who could control the Army and the Navy and was recommended by 
					Konoe and Tojo as Konoe's replacement. Hirohito rejected this option, 
					arguing that a member of the imperial family should not have to eventually 
					carry the responsibility for a war against the West as a defeat would ruin the 
					prestige of the House of Yamato. Following the advice of Kōichi Kido, he chose 
					instead Tojo, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution.
					By tradition, the Emperor needed a consensus among the elder statesmen or "jushin" 
					before appointing a prime minister, and as long as former Prime Minister Admiral Keisuke 
					Okada was opposed to Tojo, it would be impolitic for the Emperor to appoint him. During 
					the meetings of the jushin regarding Prince Konoe's succession, Okada argued against Tojo's 
					appointment while the powerful Lord Privy Seal Kōichi Kido pushed for Tojo. The result was a 
					compromise where Tojo would become Prime Minister while "re-examining" the options for 
					dealing with the crisis with the United States, though no promise was made Tojo would 
					attempt to avoid a war.
				</p>

				<p>
					After being informed of Tojo's appointment, 
					Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary: "We have 
					finally committed to war and now must do all we can to 
					launch it powerfully. But we have clumsily telegraphed our intentions. 
					We needn't have signaled what we're going to do; having [the entire Konoe cabinet] 
					resign was too much. As matters stand now we can merely keep silent and without the least effort 
					war will begin." Tojo's first speech on the radio 
					made a call for "world peace", but also stated his 
					determination to settle the "China Affair" on Japanese 
					terms and to achieve the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity 
					Sphere" that would unite all of the Asian nations together.
				</p>

				<h2>Decision for war</h2>
				<p>
					The Emperor summoned Tojo to the Imperial Palace one day before Tojo 
					took office. After being informed of his appointment, Tojo was 
					given one order from the Emperor: to make a policy review of what had been 
					sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences. Despite being vocally on the side of war, 
					Tojo nevertheless accepted the order and pledged to obey. According to Colonel Akiho Ishii, 
					a member of the Army General Staff, the newly-appointed prime minister showed a true sense of 
					loyalty to the emperor performing the duty. For example, when Ishii received from Hirohito 
					a communication saying the Army should drop the idea of stationing troops in China to counter 
					the military operations of the Western powers, he wrote a reply for Tojo for his audience with 
					the Emperor. Tojo then replied to Ishii: "If the Emperor said it should be so, then that's it for me. 
					One cannot recite arguments to the Emperor. You may keep your finely phrased memorandum.
				</p>

				<p>
					On November 2, Tojo and Chiefs of Staff Hajime Sugiyama and Osami Nagano reported to 
					Hirohito that the review had been in vain. The Emperor then gave his consent to war.
					The next day, Fleet Admiral Osami Nagano explained in detail the Pearl Harbor attack plan to Hirohito. 
					The eventual plan drawn up by Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff envisaged such a mauling of the Western powers 
					that Japanese defense perimeter lines, operating on interior lines of communications and inflicting 
					heavy Western casualties, could not be breached. In addition, the Japanese fleet which attacked 
					Pearl Harbor was under orders from Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to be prepared to return to Japan 
					on a moment's notice, should negotiations succeed. Two days later, on November 5, 
					Hirohito approved the operations plan for a war against the West and continued to hold meetings 
					with the military and Tojo until the end of the month.
				</p>

				<p>
					On November 26, 1941, US Secretary of State Cordell Hull handed Ambassador Nomura and 
					Kurusu Saburo in Washington a "draft mutual declaration of policy" and "Outline of 
					Proposed Basis for Agreement between the United States and Japan." Hull proposed that Japan 
					"withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces" from China and French Indochina in exchange 
					for lifting the oil embargo, but left the term China undefined. The "Hull note," as it is known 
					in Japan, made it clear the United States would not recognise the puppet government of Wang Jingwei 
					as the government of China but strongly implied that the United States might recognise the 
					"Empire of Manchukuo"[opinion] and did not impose a deadline for the Japanese withdrawal 
					from China. On November 27, 1941, Tojo chose to misrepresent the "Hull note" to the Cabinet 
					as an "ultimatum to Japan," which was incorrect as it did not have a timeline for its acceptance 
					and was marked "tentative" in the opening sentence, which is inconsistent with an ultimatum.
					The claim that the Americans had demanded in the "Hull note" Japanese withdrawal from all of China, 
					instead of just the parts that they had occupied since 1937, as well as the claim the note was an 
					ultimatum, was used as one of the principal excuses for choosing war with the United States. 
					On December 1, another conference finally sanctioned the "war against the United States, England, 
					and the Netherlands."
