				<h2>Arrest, trial, and execution</h2>
					<p>
						After Japan's unconditional surrender in 1945, U.S. general Douglas MacArthur ordered 
						the arrest of forty individuals suspected of war crimes, including Tojo. Five American GIs 
						were sent to serve the arrest warrant. As American soldiers surrounded Tojo's house on 
						September 11, he shot himself in the chest with a pistol, but missed his heart. As a result 
						of this experience, the Army had medical personnel present during the later arrests of other 
						accused Japanese war criminals, such as Shigetarō Shimada.
					</p>

					<p>
						As he bled, Tojo began to talk, and two Japanese reporters recorded his words: "I am very sorry 
						it is taking me so long to die. The Greater East Asia War was justified and righteous. I am very 
						sorry for the nation and all the races of the Greater Asiatic powers. 
						I wait for the righteous judgment of history. I wished to commit suicide but sometimes that fails."
					</p>

					<p>
						After recovering from his injuries, Tojo was moved to Sugamo Prison. While there, 
						he received a new set of dentures, made by an American dentist, into which the phrase
						"Remember Pearl Harbor" had been secretly drilled in Morse code. The dentist ground 
						away the message three months later.
					</p>

					<p>
						Tojo was tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for war crimes 
						and found guilty of, among other actions, waging wars of aggression; war in violation 
						of international law; unprovoked or aggressive war against various nations; and ordering, 
						authorizing, and permitting inhumane treatment of prisoners of war.
					</p>

					<p>
						Crimes committed by Imperial Japan were responsible for the deaths of millions 
						(some estimate between 3 million[106] and 14 million[107]) of civilians and prisoners 
						of war through massacre, human experimentation, starvation, and forced labor that was 
						either directly perpetrated or condoned by the Japanese military and government with a 
						significant portion of them occurring during Tojo's rule of the military. One source 
						attributes 5 million civilian deaths to Tojo's rule of the military.
					</p>

					<p>
						Tojo accepted full responsibility for his actions during the war and made this speech:
						It is natural that I should bear entire responsibility for the war in general, and, 
						needless to say, I am prepared to do so. Consequently, now that the war has been lost, 
						it is presumably necessary that I be judged so that the circumstances of the time can be 
						clarified and the future peace of the world be assured. Therefore, with respect to my trial, 
						it is my intention to speak frankly, according to my recollection, even though when the vanquished 
						stands before the victor, who has over him the power of life and death, he may be apt to toady and 
						flatter. I mean to pay considerable attention to this in my actions, and say to the end that what 
						is true is true and what is false is false. To shade one's words in flattery to the point of 
						untruthfulness would falsify the trial and do incalculable harm to the nation, and great care 
						must be taken to avoid this.
					</p>

					<p>
						Tojo was sentenced to death on November 12, 1948, and executed by 
						hanging 41 days later on December 23, 1948, a week before his 64th 
						birthday. Before his execution, he gave his military ribbons 
						to one of his guards; they are on display at the National Naval Aviation 
						Museum in Pensacola, Florida. In his final statement, he apologized 
						for the atrocities committed by the Japanese military and urged the American 
						military to show compassion toward the Japanese people, who had suffered 
						devastating air attacks and the two atomic bombings.
					</p>

					<p>
						After his execution, Tojo's body was cremated and his ashes were scattered 
						over the Pacific Ocean approximately 30 miles (48 km) east of Yokohama from a 
						US Army aircraft on the afternoon of 23 December, along with the ashes of six other Class-A war criminals.
					</p>

					<p>
						Historians Herbert P. Bix and John W. Dower criticize the work done by General 
						MacArthur and his staff to exonerate Emperor Hirohito and all members of the 
						imperial family from criminal prosecutions. According to them, MacArthur and Brigadier 
						General Bonner Fellers worked to protect the Emperor and shift ultimate responsibility to Tojo
					</p>

					<p>
						According to the written report of Shūichi Mizota, interpreter for Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, 
						Fellers met the two men at his office on March 6, 1946, and told Yonai: "It would be most 
						convenient if the Japanese side could prove to us that the Emperor is completely blameless. 
						I think the forthcoming trials offer the best opportunity to do that. Tojo, in particular, 
						should be made to bear all responsibility at this trial."
					</p>

					<p>
						The sustained intensity of this campaign to protect the Emperor was revealed when, 
						in testifying before the tribunal on December 31, 1947, Tojo momentarily strayed 
						from the agreed-upon line concerning imperial innocence and referred to the Emperor's 
						ultimate authority. The American-led prosecution immediately arranged that he be secretly 
						coached to recant this testimony. Ryūkichi Tanaka, a former general who testified at the 
						trial and had close connections with chief prosecutor Joseph B. Keenan, was used as an 
						intermediary to persuade Tojo to revise his testimony.
					</p>

				<h2>Legcay</h2>
				<p>
					Tojo's grave is now in the Grave of the Seven Martyrs(殉国七士廟) in Hazu, 
					Aichi, The grave is said to have been created by stealing parts of Tojo's 
					body that supporters were supposed to cremate and scatter in the Pacific Ocean. 
					Seven other Class A war criminals are also buried in the same grave, including Kenji 
					Doihara, Seishirō Itagaki, Heitarō Kimura, Iwane Matsui, Akira Mutō, Kōki Hirota. 
					And they are all controversially enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine. For this reason, 
					it was the site of a bombing attack by the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front in October 1971.
				</p>

				<p>
					A number of his descendants survived, including his granddaughter, 
					Yūko Tojo, who was a political hopeful who claimed Japan's war was one of self-defense 
					and that it was unfair that her grandfather was judged a Class-A war criminal. Tojo's 
					second son, Teruo Tojo, who designed fighter and passenger aircraft during and after the war, 
					eventually served as an executive at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
				</p>

				<p>
					A 1997 survey of university students in China asked, "When somebody talks about Japanese people, 
					what person do you think of?" The answer that most gave was Tojo, reflecting anti-Japanese
					sentiment in China.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the Japanese 1998 film Pride, Tojo was portrayed as a 
					national hero forced into war by the West and then executed after a rigged trial.
