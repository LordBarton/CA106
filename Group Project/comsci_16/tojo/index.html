				<h2>The Japanese Dictator</h2>
				<p>
					Hideki Tojo was a Japanese politician, military leader and convicted war criminal who served as 
					prime minister of Japan and president of the 
					Imperial Rule Assistance Association from 1941 to 1944 during World War II. 
					He assumed several more positions including chief of staff of the Imperial Army before ultimately 
					being removed from power in July 1944. 
					During his years in power, his leadership was marked by extreme state-perpetrated 
					violence in the name of Japanese ultranationalism, 
					much of which he was personally involved in.

				<p>
					Tojo was born on 30 December 1884, to a relatively low-ranking former samurai family in 
					the K≈çjimachi district of Tokyo. 
					He began his career in the Army in 1902 and steadily rose through the ranks to become a 
					general of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) by 1934. 
					In March 1937, he was promoted to chief of staff of the Kwantung Army whereby he led military 
					operations against the Chinese in Inner 
					Mongolia and the Chahar-Suiyan provinces. By July 1940, he was appointed minister of war to the 
					Japanese government led by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					On the eve of the Second World War's expansion into Asia and the Pacific, 
					Tojo was an outspoken advocate for a preemptive attack on the 
					United States and its European allies. Upon being appointed prime minister on 17 October 1941, 
					he oversaw the Empire of Japan's decision 
					to go to war as well as its ensuing conquest of much of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. 
					During the course of the war, Tojo presided 
					over numerous war crimes, including the massacre and starvation of civilians and prisoners of war, 
					as part of the wider Asian Holocaust.

				<p>
					After the war's tide decisively turned against Japan, 
					Tojo resigned as prime minister on 18 July 1944. 
					Following his nation's surrender to the Allied powers in September 1945, he was arrested, 
					convicted by the 
					International Military Tribunal for the Far East in the Tokyo Trials, sentenced to death, 
					and hanged on 23 
					December 1948. To this day, Tojo's complicity in the war crimes in the Pacific Theatre have 
					firmly intertwined 
					his legacy with the brutality shown by the Japanese Empire throughout World War II.
