<h2>The Rise of the Nazi Party</h2>
<br>
<p>After the war, Hitler return to Munich in 1918, where he joined a small German Worker's Party who's goal was to unite the working class with a strong German nationalism.
   In 1920 he left the arm and was made head of the the party's propaganda efforts.
   </p><br>
<p>One of Hitler's great propaganda ideas was adopting a version of the swastika which was originally a sacred symbol of Hinduism,Janism and Buddhism as the party's emblem, which would later strike fear to anyone who saw it in the year to come.
   <br>
   At the end of 1921, Hitler was leading the gorwing Nazi Party by capitalizing on the widespread anger about the Weimar Republic and the punishing terms of the Treaty of Versailles. This then brought many former army officer to Munich which would join the Nazi Party who recruited "strong arm" squads known as the SA, which Hitler used for the security of party meetings and also to attack the party's opponents.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>The Third Reich</h2>
<br>
<p>In 1932 Hitler ran for president, he recieved 36.8 percent of the vote. With the government in chaos and 3 consecutive chancellors failing to maintain control, Hitler was named chancellor which began the Third Reich.
   <br>
   Then in 1934 when President Hindenburg died on August 2, military leaders aggreed to combine the presidency and chancellorship into one position, meaning Hitler was commander of all the armed forces of the Country.
