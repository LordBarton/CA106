    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Adolf Hitler was born on April 20 1889 in a small border town named Braunau am Inn located on the German border. He was baptized a catholic. In 1898, his family moved to Linz, the capital of Upper Austria, where Hitler's interest in the visual arts began.In 1907, Hitler took the entrance exam to the Vienna Academy of Arts which he failed to gainacceptance. After his mother's death in 1908 Hitler would move to Vienna with a hope of renewing his efforts to enter the Academy of Arts</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was here in Vienna where Hitler's interest in Politics began. He had a keen interest in the German racist nationalism. This ideology reinfornted anti-jewish sterotypes and cast Jews as enemies of the German middle and lower classes.<br>
       Hitler then mvoed to Munich,Germany in 1913 to avoid arrest for evading his military obligation to Austria. He continued doing Art until the outbreak of World War I where gave gave Hitler a cause he could commit himself to fully.</p>

    <p>Hilter was wounded twice during the War. He was shot in the leg during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and was temporarily blinded by a British gas attack in 1918. Hitler was recovering in a hospital when the news arrived of Germany's defeat in World War I.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hilter came to believe the country's defeat was not because of the power of the Allies but due to insurriciently patriotic "traitors" at home. This ideology would undermine the post-war Weimar Republic and set the stage for Hitler's rise.<p>
