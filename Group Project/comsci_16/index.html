					<p>
						Dictators have always been a part of our world, ruining many lives all for the sake of themselves. 
						However this becomes overly apparent when you look deeper into the history of WW2, where many dictators rampaged free. 
						People such as Hitler from Germany, Stalin from the Soviet Union, Mussolini from Italy, Franco from Spain and Tojo from Japan are
						prefect examples of the bad that can happen due to these dictators. We hope that after you read through this, you will fully grasp
						the terror that a single dictator can cause, let alone a lot more at the same time.
